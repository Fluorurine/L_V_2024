    "# 05 - Structured metadata extraction for analytical question answering\n",

    "In this notebook we will be using the output of the `question-answering-using-rag.ipynb` notebook to generate structured data containing specified entities extracted from each of the documents. We will then use this structured data to answer questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook overview:\n",
    "1. Define the embedding model to initialize the vectorstore created in `04-question-answering-using-rag.ipynb` (faiss_vector_store).\n",
    "2. Define the LLM model that will be used to extract the entities.\n",
    "3. Define the entities to be extracted.\n",
    "4. Extract the entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To be able to extract relevant entities from the provided documents, the LLM needs to have a clear definition of what it is trying to extract. For example, if you want to extract the profit of a company from one of its financial reports, then asking the question \"What is the profit?\" might not be specific enough since the report can contain the profits of other companies. It may be important for your documents in S3 to contain relevant metadata that can be used in the queries to make the entities more specific.\n"

Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.
